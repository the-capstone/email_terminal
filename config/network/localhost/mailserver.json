Yes, PLEASE!  Already I have several designs planned out - I'm thinking of a new form of archives inscribed directly onto compacted sand or perhaps some sort of layered ink compressed into a circle and...look at me, going off again, I know your time is short.  Your recent focus on the underground has me somewhat alarmed - do we need such an extensive network of testbeds that far below the surface?  Why can't we build the council's projects on the surface?  There is plenty of room!  Please contact me as soon as possible!  I have a meeting with TIZONA later, and it keeps asking me what we are planning and I'm running out of excused!  It's got me quite jumbled!""

There are enough concerns on this island that we're all exposed to that I will NOT allow mutation or sickness to spread among the Council staff.  I hold this mantle, just as you hold yours.  I am tired of putting off your appointment, you're the last on my list and I have my own projects to do without having to chase you down.  Show up at my pavilion tomorrow morning or I'm coming after you myself with a scalpel and a hacksaw."
